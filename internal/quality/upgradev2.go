// Upgrades under ranking v2. The grab side ranks releases key by key (compareV2); the
// upgrade side has to read the same keys, or the two disagree — a release the sweep grabs
// as an upgrade gets refused by the import gate when it arrives, or a file is replaced by
// something v2 would never have picked over it. So under v2 a candidate replaces the file
// when the comparator ranks it above the file on one of the keys that describe the release
// itself, and the profile's "Replace for" trigger counts that key:
//
//	any:        resolution, preferences, custom, source, proper (and leaving a low-quality
//	            group's file, or one the profile no longer accepts — see escapeKey)
//	source:     resolution, preferences, custom, source
//	format:     resolution, preferences, custom
//	resolution: resolution
//
// The group, network, bitrate, health and size keys never decide an upgrade: a release
// that is only a tier-1 group's, or on the preferred network, or heavier, or better seeded
// is a tie-break between equals, not a reason to re-download a file. A heavier encode has
// its own rule (IsBitrateUpgrade), which still applies when the candidate gives nothing up
// on the keys above (noWorse). A same-group PROPER of the file is always taken, as it is
// under classic ranking.
//
// Upgrades can't loop between keys: the comparator is one total order, so a release taken
// for a source gain can't be undone by the old file winning on bitrate — bitrate never
// decides an upgrade, and the old file is the release the sweep already tried once.

// v2TriggerAllows reports whether an upgrade decided by key k is worth a re-download under
// a profile's trigger. Unlike classic ranking's triggerAllows, "any" is a list too: the
// keys that never upgrade stay out of it. Leaving the avoided tier (KeyAvoid) counts under
// every trigger: the profile already said it doesn't want that file.
